<h1>Disentangling Tahoe LAFS over I2P</h1>

<p>This presents pluginized versions of the <a href="ORIG.md">Original Instructions</a>
for hosting Tahoe-LAFS nodes over I2P. Those instructions have been turned
into shell scripts which automatically configure your Tahoe-LAFS node for
I2P-only use.</p>

<p><strong>These plugins are <em>Unix-ONLY</em> and depend on bash, python3, and virtualenv</strong></p>

<h2>An updated guide to Tahoe LAFS over I2P</h2>

<p>In order to keep the Tahoe-LAFS network sustainable over I2P, I recommend
that people who are using this guide host <strong>both</strong> an 1. "Introducer" and 2. 
either a "Client" or "Storage" node.</p>

<h3>Plugin 1: Tahoe-LAFS Introducer Node</h3>

<h4>Introduce your Introducer!</h4>

<p>New Tahoe-LAFS users need to be able to find an introducer in order to connect
to the Tahoe-LAFS network. As of the writing of this article, there are only 2
active introducers.</p>

<h3>Plugins 2 and 3: Tahoe-LAFS Client and Storage Nodes</h3>
